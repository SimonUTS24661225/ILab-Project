    # Introduction
    st.write("""
    Ammonia emissions from industrial processes result from various activities across different sectors, including chemical manufacturing, energy production, and waste management. Ammonia (NH3) is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is produced as a byproduct of certain industrial operations. While ammonia has industrial applications, excessive emissions can contribute to air pollution and pose environmental and health risks.

    # Sources of Ammonia Emissions
    st.write("### Sources of Ammonia Emissions from Industrial Processes")
    st.write("#### Chemical Manufacturing:")
    st.write("""
    Ammonia is produced as a primary product or byproduct in chemical manufacturing processes, particularly in the production of fertilizers, explosives, and synthetic materials.
    """)
    st.write("#### Energy Production:")
    st.write("""
    Ammonia emissions occur during the extraction, processing, and distribution of natural gas, as well as in coal mining and oil drilling operations.
    """)
    st.write("#### Waste Management:")
    st.write("""
    Anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in wastewater treatment facilities generates ammonia as a byproduct. Additionally, certain industrial wastes may contain ammonia, contributing to emissions during disposal.
    """)

    # Types of Ammonia Emissions
    st.write("### Types of Ammonia Emissions from Industrial Processes")
    st.write("#### Stack Emissions:")
    st.write("""
    Direct emissions from industrial stacks or chimneys release ammonia into the atmosphere during manufacturing and energy production processes.
    """)
    st.write("#### Fugitive Emissions:")
    st.write("""
    Fugitive emissions occur from leaks and unintended releases of ammonia during industrial operations, such as storage, handling, and transportation of ammonia-containing materials.
    """)

    # Preventive Measures
    st.write("### Preventive Measures to Reduce Ammonia Emissions from Industrial Processes")
    st.write("#### Emission Control Technologies:")
    st.write("""
    Implementing emission control technologies, such as scrubbers, catalytic converters, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, can capture and reduce ammonia emissions from industrial stacks.
    """)
    st.write("#### Leak Detection and Repair:")
    st.write("""
    Regular inspection and maintenance programs can help detect and repair leaks and fugitive emissions from industrial equipment and facilities to minimize ammonia releases.
    """)
    st.write("#### Process Optimization:")
    st.write("""
    Optimizing industrial processes and technologies can improve efficiency and reduce ammonia emissions by minimizing waste generation and optimizing resource utilization.
    """)
    st.write("#### Alternative Technologies:")
    st.write("""
    Exploring alternative technologies and cleaner production methods, such as green chemistry principles and renewable energy sources, can reduce reliance on ammonia-containing chemicals and processes.
