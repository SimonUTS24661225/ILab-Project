st.header("Livestock Farming and Animal Waste")
st.write("""
Livestock farming, particularly ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats, contributes to ammonia emissions through the release of animal waste and urine.
""")

st.header("Fertilizer Application")
st.write("""
The application of nitrogen-based fertilizers in agriculture leads to ammonia volatilization from the soil.
""")

st.header("Environmental Challenges")
st.write("""
These emissions pose environmental challenges, including air pollution and nutrient runoff, which can have adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. 
Ammonia emissions contribute to the formation of fine particulate matter and can exacerbate respiratory issues. Moreover, ammonia deposition can lead to nutrient imbalances in soil and water bodies, affecting biodiversity and water quality.
""")

st.header("Sustainable Agricultural Practices")
st.write("""
To address these challenges, sustainable agricultural practices are essential. Strategies such as improving manure management, optimizing fertilizer application techniques, and promoting precision agriculture can help reduce ammonia emissions.
Additionally, increasing the adoption of alternative farming methods like organic farming and agroforestry can mitigate ammonia emissions while promoting soil health and biodiversity.
