## Objectives
- This webpage is built by team EcoHealth. This page serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring the profound impact of pollution on global health. Through detailed visualizations, information, and curated content, visitors will gain an in-depth understanding of how various pollutants adversely affect the environment and consequently, human health. By examining the interconnections between air, water, and soil pollution and the incidence of health conditions worldwide, this platform aims to raise awareness and encourage proactive measures. It's an invaluable tool for educators, policymakers, and individuals alike, offering insights into the significance of environmental preservation and the urgent need for sustainable practices to safeguard our planet and our well-being.

- Talking about air pollution is just as important as discussing high blood pressure and smoking because it affects a lot of people and causes different health problems like breathing issues and heart diseases. Unlike things you choose to do, like smoking, air pollution affects everyone in a community, no matter what they do. We need to work together and change policies to make the air cleaner by reducing pollution from factories and cars. By telling people about air pollution and asking for cleaner air, we can keep ourselves and future generations healthy. So, it's really important to talk about air pollution along with other health issues like high blood pressure and smoking.
